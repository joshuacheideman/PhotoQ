Usage:
  When searching, the autosuggest will suggest something after inputting two characters and will update if you put in more letters.
  If there are less than two characters, the autosuggest box will disappear.
  You can click on the tags that have been suggested. Doing this will bring them into the tags you want to search for.
  The tags you have clicked on from the suggested tags will be used in the query and not the stuff inputted into the search bar.

  If you click on the photos, you will see a list of at most seven tags.
  You can delete the tags by clicking on the white X button for that tag.
  If there are less than seven tags, a blank tag will show up. If you input a string of characters in and hit the + button, 
  the new tag will be added.
  Adding or deleting tags will result in an AJAX query modifying the database of photos.

Note:
  AnnotateImage.js will not run without the validate key.
